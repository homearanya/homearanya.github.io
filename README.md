# Microsoft Professional Capstone : Front End Web Development

Here's the [repository](https://github.com/homearanya/React-ECommerce).

This was the [final project](https://www.edx.org/course/microsoft-professional-capstone-front-microsoft-dev238x) on the [Microsoft Professional Program for Front-End Web Development track](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/tracks/front-end-development/) (soon to be discontinued) which I successfully completed in October 2018.

With this project we had to validate the knowledge acquired throughout the program. The idea was to build a Single Page Application. I chose ReactJS.
